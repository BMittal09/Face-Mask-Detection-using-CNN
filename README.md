# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN
## Overview

This project is a Face Mask Detection System built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies whether a person is wearing a face mask or not based on image inputs. The model is trained on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces and can be used for real-time mask detection.

## Features

Deep Learning-based Face Mask Detection using CNN.

Image classification: Detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

Dataset preprocessing: Augmentation and resizing of images for better model accuracy.

Model Training & Evaluation with accuracy metrics.

Real-time detection using OpenCV (optional integration).

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two categories:

With Mask – Images of people wearing face masks.

Without Mask – Images of people without face masks.

The dataset is preprocessed with image augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and flipping to enhance model generalization.

## Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV (for real-time detection, optional)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

NumPy & Pandas (for data processing)
